# HS-Magnet-Sorter

## About
- Minimalistic Package (if you'd even call it a package XD).
- Nothing fancy, just re-organizes an array of strings (magent links).
- Allows the user to generate a range.
- Place links inside `links.txt` inside the `data/` dir.
- Get `output.txt`
- profit!?!?

## Future Plans?
- Implement API using a url/REST endpoint?
- Add it to jj-bot?
- GUI application?
- CLI Package?
